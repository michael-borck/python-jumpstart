## Chapter Outline
- Understanding the `print()` function and its capabilities
- Formatting and displaying different types of data effectively
- String formatting techniques from basic to advanced
- Multi-line output and text design principles
- Creating professional user interfaces with text
- Building the chatbot's communication system

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Use the `print()` function with confidence to display different types of information
- Output and format various data types (strings, numbers, variables) clearly
- Apply a range of formatting techniques for professional presentation
- Create visually structured terminal output that enhances user experience
- Implement an expressive output system for your chatbot project
- Use the `help()` function to discover capabilities of Python's built-in functions

## 1. Introduction: Why Output Matters

In programming, output is your code's voice—how it communicates with users and the world. Without output, your code would work silently in the background, with no way to show its results or interact with users. This is like having thoughts but no way to express them.

Output is particularly crucial in conversational applications like our chatbot project. Just as humans convey meaning through both what they say and how they say it, programs use output not just to display raw information, but to communicate in a way that's clear, useful, and engaging.

> **Key Concept**: Effective output is about more than just displaying information—it's about communicating with purpose, guiding users, and creating an engaging experience that meets users' needs.

Whether you're building a personal chatbot, a data analysis tool, or a complex web application, your output system forms the foundation of the user experience. In the AI era, where machines and humans collaborate more closely than ever, thoughtful output design bridges the gap between computational processes and human understanding.

## 2. The `print()` Function: Your Output Assistant

Python's `print()` function is your primary tool for displaying information to users. While seemingly simple, it offers remarkable flexibility:

```python
# Basic print function usage
print('Hello, World!')  # Displays: Hello, World!
```

The `print()` function can display virtually any type of data Python supports:

```python
# Printing different types of values
print('Hello, World!')         # Strings (text)
print(42)                      # Integers (whole numbers)
print(3.14159)                 # Floating-point numbers (decimals)
print(True)                    # Booleans (True/False)
print(None)                    # None value (absence of value)
print([1, 2, 3])               # Lists (collections)
print({'name': 'Alice'})       # Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
```

When you pass data to `print()`, Python automatically converts it to a string representation for display. This is why you can print numbers, booleans, and other non-string values directly.

### Multiple Items in One Print Statement

You can display multiple items in a single `print()` call by separating them with commas:

```python
# Printing multiple items
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)  # Displays: Name: Alice Age: 30
```

Notice that `print()` automatically adds spaces between multiple items. This behavior can be customized, as we'll see shortly.

### Interactive vs. Script Environments

Output behaves differently depending on your programming environment:

```python
# In a Jupyter notebook or interactive environment
age = 21
age  # This displays the value directly: 21

# In a Python script, you need print()
age = 21
# Just writing 'age' here doesn't display anything
print(age)  # This explicitly shows the value: 21
```

> **Pro Tip**: When writing code that will be run as a script (not in an interactive environment like Jupyter), always use `print()` to display information. Simply referring to a variable won't show its value when the script runs.

## 3. Customizing Your Output

The `print()` function accepts several parameters that let you control exactly how output appears.

### Separators and End Characters

These parameters give you fine-grained control over output formatting:

```python
# The 'sep' parameter: what goes between multiple items
print("Name", "Alice", "Age", 30, sep=": ")         # Name: Alice: Age: 30
print("Name", "Alice", "Age", 30, sep=" | ")        # Name | Alice | Age | 30
print("Name", "Alice", "Age", 30, sep="\n")         # Each item on a new line

# The 'end' parameter: what goes at the end (default is newline '\n')
print("Hello", end="! ")
print("World")                                      # Hello! World

print("Item 1", end=" → ")
print("Item 2", end=" → ")
print("Item 3")                                     # Item 1 → Item 2 → Item 3
```

These parameters are particularly useful for creating custom layouts, tables, or progress indicators:

```python
# Creating a simple progress indicator
import time

print("Processing", end="")
for _ in range(10):
    time.sleep(0.3)  # Simulate work
    print(".", end="", flush=True)  # flush ensures immediate display
print(" Done!")      # Processing......... Done!
```

### The File Parameter

By default, `print()` sends output to the screen (specifically to `sys.stdout`), but you can redirect it:

```python
# Printing to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    print("This text goes to a file", file=file)
    print("More text in the file", file=file)

# Printing to standard error
import sys
print("Warning: something unusual happened", file=sys.stderr)
```

## 4. String Formatting: From Basic to Advanced

String formatting is essential for creating clear, professional output. Python offers several approaches, each with its own strengths.

### String Concatenation (Basic)

The simplest approach is to build strings using the `+` operator:

```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
print(greeting)  # Hello, Alice!
```

While simple, this becomes cumbersome for complex formatting and requires explicit type conversion:

```python
age = 30
# print("You are " + age + " years old.")  # TypeError!
print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")  # Correct, but unwieldy
```

### The Format Method (Intermediate)

The `.format()` method offers more flexibility:

```python
name = "Bob"
age = 35
message = "Hello, {}! You are {} years old.".format(name, age)
print(message)  # Hello, Bob! You are 35 years old.

# With position specifiers
message = "Hello, {0}! You are {1} years old. Nice to meet you, {0}!".format(name, age)
print(message)  # Hello, Bob! You are 35 years old. Nice to meet you, Bob!

# With named placeholders
message = "Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.".format(name=name, age=age)
print(message)  # Hello, Bob! You are 35 years old.
```

### F-Strings: Modern Python's Formatting Powerhouse

F-strings (formatted string literals, introduced in Python 3.6) combine simplicity with power:

```python
name = "Charlie"
age = 40
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")  # Hello, Charlie! You are 40 years old.
```

F-strings allow you to evaluate expressions inside the curly braces:

```python
# Arithmetic within f-strings
price = 19.99
quantity = 3
print(f"Total: ${price * quantity:.2f}")  # Total: $59.97

# Function calls within f-strings
text = "python"
print(f"Uppercase: {text.upper()}")  # Uppercase: PYTHON

# Conditionals within f-strings (Python 3.8+)
temperature = 75
print(f"It's {temperature}°F - {'warm' if temperature > 70 else 'cool'}")  # It's 75°F - warm
```

### Precision Formatting for Numbers

For data-intensive applications, precise number formatting is essential:

```python
value = 123.456789

# Controlling decimal places
print(f"Fixed point, 2 decimal places: {value:.2f}")  # 123.46
print(f"Fixed point, 4 decimal places: {value:.4f}")  # 123.4568

# Width and alignment
print(f"|{value:10.2f}|")  # |    123.46|  (10 char width)
print(f"|{value:<10.2f}|") # |123.46    |  (left-aligned)
print(f"|{value:^10.2f}|") # |  123.46  |  (center-aligned)

# With thousands separator
big_number = 1234567.89
print(f"With commas: {big_number:,.2f}")  # 1,234,567.89

# Scientific notation
print(f"Scientific: {value:e}")  # 1.234568e+02
```

## 5. Creating Visual Structure in Output

Well-structured output makes information easier to understand and use. Python's string manipulation capabilities allow you to create visually appealing text interfaces.

### Using Repetition and Alignment

```python
# Creating borders and dividers
print("=" * 50)  # ==================================================
print("-" * 50)  # --------------------------------------------------

# Centering text
title = "USER PROFILE"
print(f"{title:=^50}")  # ===================USER PROFILE====================

# Creating a simple framed header
width = 50
print("+" + "-" * (width - 2) + "+")
print(f"|{title:^{width-2}}|")
print("+" + "-" * (width - 2) + "+")
```

### Building a Structured Information Display

```python
def display_user_profile(name, age, email, location):
    """Display a structured user profile with visual formatting."""
    width = 60

    # Header
    print("\n" + "=" * width)
    print(f"{'USER PROFILE':^{width}}")
    print("=" * width)

    # Main content with aligned fields
    print(f"  {'Name:':<12} {name}")
    print(f"  {'Age:':<12} {age}")
    print(f"  {'Email:':<12} {email}")
    print(f"  {'Location:':<12} {location}")

    # Footer
    print("-" * width)
    print(f"{'Profile generated on: 2023-07-15':^{width}}")
    print("=" * width + "\n")

# Using our display function
display_user_profile("Alice Johnson", 32, "alice@example.com", "New York, NY")
```

This produces:
```
============================================================
                       USER PROFILE
============================================================
  Name:        Alice Johnson
  Age:         32
  Email:       alice@example.com
  Location:    New York, NY
------------------------------------------------------------
               Profile generated on: 2023-07-15
============================================================
```

### Multi-line Text with Triple Quotes

For longer text blocks, triple quotes create multi-line strings:

```python
instructions = """
WELCOME TO PYTHON ADVENTURE!
===========================

In this text-based game, you'll explore a virtual world
using simple commands:

  - NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST: Move in that direction
  - LOOK: Examine your surroundings
  - INVENTORY: Check your items
  - TAKE [item]: Pick up an object
  - USE [item]: Use an item in your inventory

Type HELP at any time to see these instructions again.
Let's begin your adventure!
"""

print(instructions)
```

> **Visual Design Tip**: Use elements like borders, alignment, and spacing consistently throughout your application. This creates a visual language that helps users understand the information's structure and importance.

## 6. Special Characters and Escape Sequences

Python uses backslash escape sequences to represent special characters:

```python
# Common escape sequences
print("Line 1\nLine 2")           # \n creates a new line
print("Column 1\tColumn 2")       # \t creates a tab
print("She said, \"Hello!\"")     # \" for quotes inside a string
print("C:\\Program Files\\Python") # \\ for backslash

# Less common but useful escape sequences
print("Bell sound: \a")           # \a produces an alert (bell) sound
print("Backspace: Hello\bWorld")  # \b is backspace (rarely used)
print("Form\ffeed")               # \f is form feed (page break)
print("Carriage\rreturn")         # \r returns to start of line

# Unicode characters (Python 3)
print("\u2764 Python")            # ❤ Python (Unicode heart)
print("\N{ROCKET}")               # 🚀 (Unicode rocket by name)
```

> **Tip**: The `repr()` function shows the raw string with escape sequences: `print(repr("Hello\nWorld"))` displays `'Hello\nWorld'` with the `\n` visible rather than creating a new line.

## 7. Getting Help with the `help()` Function

Python's `help()` function is your built-in documentation browser:

```python
# Learn about the print() function
help(print)
```

This displays:
```
Help on built-in function print in module builtins:

print(...)
    print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
    Optional keyword arguments:
    file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
    sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
    end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
    flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.
```

You can use `help()` with any Python function, method, or module:

```python
help(str.format)      # Documentation for string formatting
help(f"{}")           # Documentation for f-strings (in Python 3.6+)
```

> **Learning Tip**: Make `help()` your go-to resource when exploring Python. It provides accurate, up-to-date information about the exact version of Python you're using.

## 8. Project Corner: Building Your Chatbot's Voice

Now let's apply what we've learned to develop our chatbot project. A chatbot's ability to communicate clearly is crucial for creating a good user experience.

### Chatbot Basic Output Structure

Let's create a distinctive and user-friendly output system for our chatbot:

```python
# Chatbot output structure - Version 1.0
bot_name = "PyBot"
version = "1.0"

# Welcome message with visual elements
width = 60
print("\n" + "=" * width)
print(f"{bot_name} v{version}".center(width))
print("Your Python Learning Assistant".center(width))
print("=" * width)

# Introduction using multi-line formatted output
print(f"""
Hello! I'm {bot_name}, a Python-powered chatbot created to assist with
your learning journey.

As you progress through this book, I'll evolve with new capabilities
that demonstrate Python concepts in action. Right now, I can:

  • Display formatted messages (using what you just learned!)
  • Provide visual structure to information
  • Show different types of message formatting

Soon, I'll be able to respond to your inputs, remember information,
make decisions, and much more!
""")

# Closing line with different formatting
print("\n" + "-" * width)
print(f"{bot_name}> I'm looking forward to our conversations!")
print("-" * width + "\n")
```

This produces a professional-looking interface:
```
============================================================
                      PyBot v1.0
                Your Python Learning Assistant
============================================================

Hello! I'm PyBot, a Python-powered chatbot created to assist with
your learning journey.

As you progress through this book, I'll evolve with new capabilities
that demonstrate Python concepts in action. Right now, I can:

  • Display formatted messages (using what you just learned!)
  • Provide visual structure to information
  • Show different types of message formatting

Soon, I'll be able to respond to your inputs, remember information,
make decisions, and much more!

------------------------------------------------------------
PyBot> I'm looking forward to our conversations!
------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Message Types for Different Purposes

In a real chatbot, different types of messages serve different purposes. Let's create specific formatting for each message type:

```python
def chatbot_output(message_type, text):
    """Display chatbot messages with appropriate formatting.

    Args:
        message_type: The type of message ('normal', 'system', 'error', or 'help')
        text: The message content
    """
    bot_name = "PyBot"

    if message_type == "normal":
        # Regular conversational message
        print(f"{bot_name}> {text}")

    elif message_type == "system":
        # System notifications and status updates
        print(f"[SYSTEM] {text}")

    elif message_type == "error":
        # Error messages stand out with asterisks
        print(f"{bot_name} [ERROR]> {text}")
        print(f"{'*' * (len(text) + 18)}")

    elif message_type == "help":
        # Help messages with special formatting
        print("\n" + "-" * 60)
        print(f"{bot_name} HELP".center(60))
        print("-" * 60)
        print(f"{text}")
        print("-" * 60 + "\n")

# Example usage
chatbot_output("normal", "Hello! How can I help you today?")
chatbot_output("system", "Processing your request...")
chatbot_output("error", "I couldn't understand that command.")
chatbot_output("help", """
Available commands:
- HELLO: Greet the chatbot
- HELP: Show this help message
- BYE: End the conversation
""")
```

Output:
```
PyBot> Hello! How can I help you today?
[SYSTEM] Processing your request...
PyBot [ERROR]> I couldn't understand that command.
**************************************************

------------------------------------------------------------
                        PyBot HELP
------------------------------------------------------------

Available commands:
- HELLO: Greet the chatbot
- HELP: Show this help message
- BYE: End the conversation

------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Simulating a Complete Conversation

Let's put it all together to simulate a complete chatbot conversation:

```python
import time

def simulate_chatbot_conversation():
    """Simulate a conversation with our chatbot using different output techniques."""
    bot_name = "PyBot"
    width = 60

    # Welcome screen
    print("\n" + "=" * width)
    print(f"{bot_name} Chat Simulation".center(width))
    print("=" * width)

    # Initial greeting
    print(f"\n{bot_name}> Hello! I'm {bot_name}, your Python assistant.")
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"{bot_name}> What's your name?")

    # Simulate user input
    time.sleep(1.5)
    user_name = "Alex"
    print(f"{user_name}> My name is {user_name}.")

    # Bot response with formatted output
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"{bot_name}> Nice to meet you, {user_name}!")
    time.sleep(0.8)
    print(f"{bot_name}> I can help you learn Python concepts.")

    # System message
    time.sleep(1.2)
    print(f"[SYSTEM] {bot_name} is retrieving information...")
    time.sleep(1.5)

    # Information display with structure
    print(f"\n{bot_name}> Here are today's Python topics:")
    print("  • Variables and data types")
    print("  • Input and output techniques")
    print("  • String formatting with f-strings")
    print("  • Basic control structures")

    # Error message simulation
    time.sleep(1.5)
    print(f"\n{user_name}> Can you write my homework for me?")
    time.sleep(1.2)
    print(f"{bot_name} [ERROR]> I'm designed to help you learn, not to do your work for you.")
    print("*" * 65)

    # Help message
    time.sleep(1.5)
    print(f"\n{user_name}> help")
    time.sleep(1)
    print("\n" + "-" * width)
    print(f"{bot_name} HELP".center(width))
    print("-" * width)
    print("""
Commands you can try:
- ASK [question]: Ask me about Python
- TOPICS: Show available topics
- EXAMPLE [topic]: Get an example about a topic
- BYE: End our conversation
    """)
    print("-" * width)

    # Ending the conversation
    time.sleep(1.5)
    print(f"\n{user_name}> bye")
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"{bot_name}> Goodbye, {user_name}! Happy coding!")
    print("\n" + "=" * width)
    print("End of simulation".center(width))
    print("=" * width + "\n")

# Run the simulation
simulate_chatbot_conversation()
```

This demonstration shows how effective output techniques can create an engaging, user-friendly conversational interface. As we progress through the book, we'll expand our chatbot with real interactive capabilities.

> **Project Evolution**: In this chapter, we're focusing on the output side of our chatbot. In Chapter 6, we'll add user input capabilities, and in later chapters, we'll implement logic to make the chatbot truly interactive.

## 9. AI Collaboration Corner: Designing Effective Output

Let's explore how AI assistants can help you design better output for your Python applications.

### Before: Vague Prompting

```
Help me with Python print formatting.
```

**AI Response:**
*Python's print() function is versatile and offers many formatting options. You can use f-strings, format() method, or % formatting. Each approach has its own syntax and benefits. What specific formatting task are you trying to accomplish?*

This response is correct but generic, requiring more back-and-forth to get specific help.

### After: Detailed, Specific Prompting

```
I'm building a Python chatbot and need to design its output formatting. I want:
1. Different visual styles for regular messages, errors, and system notifications
2. A consistent visual identity (borders, spacing, etc.)
3. Examples of how to format timestamps and user information

Please show code examples for each of these needs, optimized for readability on a terminal interface.
```

**AI Response:**
*Here's a comprehensive approach to designing your chatbot's output formatting:*

```python
import time
from datetime import datetime

def format_regular_message(bot_name, message):
    """Format a regular conversational message."""
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")
    return f"{timestamp} {bot_name}> {message}"

def format_error_message(bot_name, error):
    """Format an error message with visual emphasis."""
    width = len(error) + 10
    return f"""
{'!' * width}
{bot_name} ERROR: {error}
{'!' * width}
"""

def format_system_notification(notification):
    """Format a system notification or status update."""
    return f"[SYSTEM] {notification}"

def format_user_info(user_name, user_level, last_active):
    """Format user information in a structured display."""
    return f"""
┌─── User Profile ───┐
│ Name: {user_name:<12} │
│ Level: {user_level:<11} │
│ Last seen: {last_active:<8} │
└────────────────────┘
"""

# Example usage:
bot_name = "ChatPy"
print(format_regular_message(bot_name, "Hello! How can I help you today?"))
print(format_error_message(bot_name, "Could not process that request"))
print(format_system_notification("Updating knowledge base..."))
print(format_user_info("Alex", "Beginner", "2 days ago"))
```

*This design creates distinct visual styles for different message types:*
- *Regular messages include timestamps for conversation flow*
- *Error messages stand out with exclamation borders*
- *System notifications use square brackets as a subtle indicator*
- *User info appears in a box-drawing frame*

*For consistency, you could also create a config dictionary with your visual elements:*

```python
CHAT_STYLE = {
    "primary_color": "*",   # For main headers
    "secondary_color": "-", # For sub-headers
    "regular_prefix": ">",  # For regular messages
    "width": 60            # Consistent width for formatting
}
```

*This approach creates a consistent visual language that users will quickly learn to navigate.*

### How to Craft Effective Prompts for Output Design

When working with an AI assistant on output formatting:

1. **Be specific about the context and purpose** of your output (e.g., terminal application, log file, chatbot interface)

2. **Describe the visual hierarchy** you want to establish (what should stand out, what should be subtle)

3. **Ask for specific techniques** rather than general advice (e.g., "How can I create boxed text in a terminal?" rather than "How should I format output?")

4. **Include examples of your current output** if you're trying to improve existing code

5. **Request alternatives** to compare different approaches

For example:

```
I'm creating a data analysis report that will be viewed in the terminal.
I need to display:
1. A prominent title
2. Summary statistics (min, max, average)
3. Data warnings when values exceed thresholds

Show me 2-3 different ways to format this information using Python's
print() function, focusing on readability and visual hierarchy.
```

This specific prompt will yield practical designs tailored to your exact needs.

## 10. Common Output Pitfalls to Avoid

As you develop your output systems, watch for these common issues:

### Type Conversion Errors

```python
# Incorrect
age = 30
# print("You are " + age + " years old.")  # TypeError: can't concatenate str and int

# Correct approaches
print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")  # Explicit conversion
print(f"You are {age} years old.")           # f-strings handle conversion
```

### Inconsistent Formatting

Inconsistent formatting confuses users and looks unprofessional:

```python
# Inconsistent formatting - bad practice
print("Name: " + user_name)
print(f"Age: {user_age}")
print("Location:", user_location)

# Consistent formatting - good practice
print(f"Name: {user_name}")
print(f"Age: {user_age}")
print(f"Location: {user_location}")
```

### Neglecting Edge Cases

Always consider how your output will handle extreme values or unexpected input:

```python
# Potential issues with long input
username = "TheVeryLongUsernameWithManyCharactersThatMightBreakFormatting"

# Poor handling - will break your layout
print(f"|{username:20}|")  # |TheVeryLongUsernamew|  (truncated)

# Better approach - handle long inputs gracefully
max_length = 20
display_name = username[:max_length-3] + "..." if len(username) > max_length else username
print(f"|{display_name:20}|")  # |TheVeryLongUserna...|
```

### Forgetting to Flush Output

For real-time updates (like progress indicators), remember to flush the output buffer:

```python
# Without flush, dots might appear all at once
for i in range(10):
    print(".", end="")
    time.sleep(0.5)

# With flush, dots appear as they're printed
for i in range(10):
    print(".", end="", flush=True)
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

### Hard-Coding Values That Should Be Variables

```python
# Hard-coded values - harder to maintain
print("Welcome to ChatPy v1.0!")
print("ChatPy> How can I help you?")

# Better approach - use variables
bot_name = "ChatPy"
version = "1.0"
print(f"Welcome to {bot_name} v{version}!")
print(f"{bot_name}> How can I help you?")
```

## 11. Real-World Output Examples

Let's examine how output techniques are used in professional applications:

### Command-Line Interface (CLI) Tools

CLI tools need clear, structured output to guide users:

```python
def display_help_menu(command=None):
    """Display a help menu similar to professional CLI tools."""
    if command is None:
        # Main help menu
        print("\nFILE MANAGER - Available Commands\n")
        print("  list          List files in current directory")
        print("  search TEXT   Search for files containing TEXT")
        print("  copy SRC DST  Copy file from SRC to DST")
        print("  help COMMAND  Show help for specific command\n")
        print("Use 'exit' to quit the program\n")
    elif command == "search":
        # Command-specific help
        print("\nSEARCH COMMAND\n")
        print("  search TEXT   Search for files containing TEXT")
        print("\nOptions:")
        print("  -i            Case-insensitive search")
        print("  -r            Recursive search in subdirectories\n")
        print("Example: search -i -r 'python'")

# Sample usage
display_help_menu()
print("\n")
display_help_menu("search")
```

### Data Analysis Reports

Data analysis tools often display tabular data and statistics:

```python
def display_data_summary(dataset_name, data_points, statistics):
    """Display a professional data analysis summary."""
    width = 70

    # Header with dataset information
    print("\n" + "=" * width)
    print(f" {dataset_name} Analysis Summary ".center(width, "="))
    print("=" * width)

    # Dataset information
    print(f"\nDataset contains {data_points} data points\n")

    # Statistics table
    print(" " + "-" * (width - 2))
    print(f" {'Statistic':<20} | {'Value':<20} | {'Interpretation':<25}")
    print(" " + "-" * (width - 2))

    for stat, values in statistics.items():
        value, interpretation = values
        # Format numbers with commas and appropriate decimal places
        if isinstance(value, float):
            formatted_value = f"{value:,.2f}"
        elif isinstance(value, int):
            formatted_value = f"{value:,}"
        else:
            formatted_value = value

        print(f" {stat:<20} | {formatted_value:<20} | {interpretation:<25}")

    print(" " + "-" * (width - 2))

    # Footer with timestamp
    from datetime import datetime
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    print("\n" + "-" * width)
    print(f" Report generated: {timestamp} ".center(width, "-"))
    print("=" * width + "\n")

# Sample usage
sample_stats = {
    "Mean": [42.5, "Within expected range"],
    "Median": [38.0, "Lower than previous month"],
    "Std Deviation": [12.34, "High variance detected"],
    "Min Value": [10, "No outliers detected"],
    "Max Value": [95, "Investigate high values"],
    "Total": [1250000, "Exceeds quarterly target"]
}

display_data_summary("Customer Engagement", 2500, sample_stats)
```

### Interactive Applications

Interactive applications need responsive, clear output:

```python
def simulate_interactive_menu():
    """Simulate an interactive menu system with user feedback."""
    options = ["View Profile", "Settings", "Help", "Exit"]
    selected = 0

    while True:
        # Clear the display (this would clear the terminal in a real application)
        print("\n" * 5)

        # Display title
        print("\n" + "=" * 40)
        print("INTERACTIVE MENU DEMO".center(40))
        print("=" * 40 + "\n")

        # Display options with selected item highlighted
        for i, option in enumerate(options):
            if i == selected:
                print(f" > {option} <".center(40))
            else:
                print(f"   {option}   ".center(40))

        # Display navigation instructions
        print("\n" + "-" * 40)
        print("Navigation: [N]ext, [P]revious, [S]elect, [Q]uit")
        print("-" * 40)

        # Simulate user input (in a real app, you'd get actual input)
        import random
        choice = random.choice(['n', 'p', 's', 'q'])

        # Process the simulated choice
        if choice == 'n':
            selected = (selected + 1) % len(options)
            print("\n[SYSTEM] Selected next item")
        elif choice == 'p':
            selected = (selected - 1) % len(options)
            print("\n[SYSTEM] Selected previous item")
        elif choice == 's':
            print(f"\n[SYSTEM] You selected: {options[selected]}")
            if options[selected] == "Exit":
                break
        elif choice == 'q':
            print("\n[SYSTEM] Quitting demo...")
            break

        # Pause to see the output (only for simulation)
        import time
        time.sleep(1.5)

    print("\nInteractive menu demo finished\n")

# Run the interactive menu simulation
# simulate_interactive_menu()  # Commented out to avoid long output
```

These examples demonstrate how professional applications use structured output to create effective user experiences. The techniques are the same as those we've covered—just applied with consistency and purpose.
