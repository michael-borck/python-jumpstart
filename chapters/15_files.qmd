# Chapter 15: Files - Persisting Your Data

## Chapter Outline
- Understanding file operations
- Opening and closing files
- Reading from files
- Writing to files
- Working with different file modes
- File paths and directories
- Using the with statement
- Common file operations
- Handling text and binary files

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand how file operations work in Python
- Read data from text files
- Write and append data to files
- Safely manage file resources with the with statement
- Work with file paths and different file formats
- Create programs that persist data between runs
- Implement file operations in practical applications

## 1. Introduction: Why Store Data in Files?

So far, all the programs we've written have been ephemeral - the data exists only while the program is running. Once the program ends, all the variables, lists, and dictionaries vanish from memory. But what if you want to save your data for later use? Or what if you want to share data between different programs?

This is where files come in. Files allow your programs to:

- Save data permanently on disk
- Read existing data into your programs
- Share information between different programs
- Process large amounts of data that wouldn't fit in memory
- Import data from external sources
- Export results for other applications to use

In this chapter, we'll learn how to read from and write to files, which is a fundamental skill for creating useful programs.

***AI Tip: Ask your AI assistant to help you understand the difference between volatile memory (RAM) and persistent storage (disk) in computing.***

## 2. Understanding File Operations

Working with files in Python typically follows a three-step process:

1. **Open** the file, which creates a connection to the file and prepares it for reading or writing
2. **Read from** or **write to** the file
3. **Close** the file to save changes and free up system resources

Let's look at the basic syntax:

```python
# Step 1: Open the file
file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # 'r' means "read mode"

# Step 2: Read from the file
content = file.read()
print(content)

# Step 3: Close the file
file.close()
```

The `open()` function takes two arguments:
- The filename (or path)
- The mode (how you want to use the file)

Common file modes include:
- `'r'` - Read (default): Open for reading
- `'w'` - Write: Open for writing (creates a new file or truncates an existing one)
- `'a'` - Append: Open for writing, appending to the end of the file
- `'r+'` - Read+Write: Open for both reading and writing
- `'b'` - Binary mode (added to other modes, e.g., `'rb'` for reading binary files)

## 3. Using the with Statement: A Safer Approach

It's crucial to close files after you're done with them, but it's easy to forget or miss this step if an error occurs. Python provides a cleaner solution with the `with` statement, which automatically closes the file when the block is exited:

```python
# A safer way to work with files
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
# File is automatically closed when the block exits
```

This approach is preferred because:
- It's more concise
- The file is automatically closed, even if an error occurs
- It follows Python's "context manager" pattern for resource management

Throughout this chapter, we'll use the `with` statement for all file operations.

## 4. Reading from Files

Python offers several methods for reading file content:

### Reading the Entire File

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()  # Reads the entire file into a single string
    print(content)
```

### Reading Line by Line

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read one line at a time
    first_line = file.readline()
    second_line = file.readline()
    print(first_line.strip())  # .strip() removes the newline character
    print(second_line.strip())
```

### Reading All Lines into a List

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()  # Returns a list where each element is a line

    for line in lines:
        print(line.strip())
```

### Iterating Over a File

The most memory-efficient way to process large files is to iterate directly over the file object:

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:  # File objects are iterable
        print(line.strip())
```

This approach reads only one line at a time into memory, which is ideal for large files.

## 5. Writing to Files

Writing to files is just as straightforward as reading:

### Creating a New File or Overwriting an Existing One

```python
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, world!\n')  # \n adds a newline
    file.write('This is a new file.')
```

This creates a new file named `output.txt` (or overwrites it if it already exists) with the content "Hello, world!" followed by "This is a new file." on the next line.

### Appending to an Existing File

If you want to add content to the end of an existing file without overwriting it, use the append mode:

```python
with open('log.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write('New log entry\n')
```

### Writing Multiple Lines at Once

The `writelines()` method lets you write multiple lines from a list:

```python
lines = ['First line\n', 'Second line\n', 'Third line\n']

with open('multiline.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(lines)
```

Note that `writelines()` doesn't add newline characters automatically; you need to include them in your strings.

## 6. Working with File Paths

So far, we've worked with files in the current directory. To work with files in other locations, you need to specify the path:

### Absolute Paths

An absolute path specifies the complete location from the root directory:

```python
# Windows example
with open(r'C:\Users\Username\Documents\file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()

# Mac/Linux example
with open('/home/username/documents/file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
```

Note the `r` prefix in the Windows example, which creates a "raw string" that doesn't interpret backslashes as escape characters.

### Relative Paths

A relative path specifies the location relative to the current directory:

```python
# File in the current directory
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()

# File in a subdirectory
with open('data/file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()

# File in the parent directory
with open('../file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
```

### Using the os.path Module

For platform-independent code, use the `os.path` module to handle file paths:

```python
import os

# Join path components
file_path = os.path.join('data', 'user_info', 'profile.txt')

# Check if a file exists
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
else:
    print(f"File {file_path} does not exist")
```

## 7. Common File Operations

Beyond basic reading and writing, here are some common file operations:

### Checking if a File Exists

```python
import os

if os.path.exists('file.txt'):
    print("The file exists")
else:
    print("The file does not exist")
```

### Creating Directories

```python
import os

# Create a single directory
os.mkdir('new_folder')

# Create multiple nested directories
os.makedirs('parent/child/grandchild')
```

### Listing Files in a Directory

```python
import os

# List all files and directories
entries = os.listdir('.')  # '.' represents the current directory
print(entries)
```

### Deleting Files

```python
import os

# Delete a file
if os.path.exists('unwanted.txt'):
    os.remove('unwanted.txt')
```

### Renaming Files

```python
import os

# Rename a file
os.rename('old_name.txt', 'new_name.txt')
```

## 8. Working with CSV Files

Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files are a common format for storing tabular data. Python provides the `csv` module for working with CSV files:

### Reading CSV Files

```python
import csv

with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)

    # Skip the header row (if present)
    header = next(csv_reader)
    print(f"Column names: {header}")

    # Process each row
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)  # Each row is a list of values
```

### Writing CSV Files

```python
import csv

data = [
    ['Name', 'Age', 'City'],  # Header row
    ['Alice', 25, 'New York'],
    ['Bob', 30, 'San Francisco'],
    ['Charlie', 35, 'Los Angeles']
]

with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(file)

    # Write all rows at once
    csv_writer.writerows(data)
```

## 9. Working with JSON Files

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a popular data format that's particularly useful for storing hierarchical data. Python's `json` module makes it easy to work with JSON files:

### Reading JSON Files

```python
import json

with open('config.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)  # Parses JSON into a Python dictionary

    print(data['name'])
    print(data['settings']['theme'])
```

### Writing JSON Files

```python
import json

data = {
    'name': 'MyApp',
    'version': '1.0',
    'settings': {
        'theme': 'dark',
        'notifications': True,
        'users': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
    }
}

with open('config.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)  # indent for pretty formatting
```

## 10. Self-Assessment Quiz

1. Which file mode would you use to add data to the end of an existing file?
   a) `'r'`
   b) `'w'`
   c) `'a'`
   d) `'x'`

2. What is the main advantage of using the `with` statement when working with files?
   a) It makes the code run faster
   b) It automatically closes the file even if an error occurs
   c) It allows you to open multiple files at once
   d) It compresses the file content

3. Which method reads the entire content of a file as a single string?
   a) `file.readline()`
   b) `file.readlines()`
   c) `file.read()`
   d) `file.extract()`

4. What happens if you open a file in write mode (`'w'`) that already exists?
   a) Python raises an error
   b) The existing file is deleted and a new empty file is created
   c) Python appends to the existing file
   d) Python asks for confirmation before proceeding

5. Which module would you use to work with CSV files in Python?
   a) `csv`
   b) `excel`
   c) `tabular`
   d) `data`

**Answers & Feedback:**
1. c) `'a'` — Append mode adds new content to the end of an existing file
2. b) It automatically closes the file even if an error occurs — This prevents resource leaks
3. c) `file.read()` — This method reads the entire file into memory as a string
4. b) The existing file is deleted and a new empty file is created — Be careful with write mode!
5. a) `csv` — Python's built-in module for working with CSV files

## 11. Common File Handling Pitfalls

- **Not closing files**: Always close files or use the `with` statement to avoid resource leaks
- **Hardcoding file paths**: Use relative paths or `os.path` functions for more portable code
- **Assuming file existence**: Check if a file exists before trying to read it
- **Using the wrong mode**: Make sure to use the appropriate mode for your intended operation
- **Loading large files into memory**: Use iterative approaches for large files to avoid memory issues
- **Not handling encoding issues**: Specify the encoding when working with text files containing special characters

## Project Corner: Persistent Chatbot with File Storage

Let's enhance our chatbot by adding the ability to save and load conversations:

```python
import datetime
import os
import random

# Using dictionaries for response patterns
response_patterns = {
    "greetings": ["hello", "hi", "hey", "howdy", "hola"],
    "farewells": ["bye", "goodbye", "see you", "cya", "farewell"],
    "gratitude": ["thanks", "thank you", "appreciate"],
    "bot_questions": ["who are you", "what are you", "your name"],
    "user_questions": ["how are you", "what's up", "how do you feel"]
}

response_templates = {
    "greetings": ["Hello there! How can I help you today?", "Hi! Nice to chat with you!"],
    "farewells": ["Goodbye! Come back soon!", "See you later! Have a great day!"],
    "gratitude": ["You're welcome!", "Happy to help!"],
    "bot_questions": ["I'm PyBot, a simple chatbot built with Python!"],
    "user_questions": ["I'm functioning well, thanks for asking!"]
}

def get_response(user_input):
    """Get a response based on the user input."""
    user_input = user_input.lower()

    # Check each category of responses
    for category, patterns in response_patterns.items():
        for pattern in patterns:
            if pattern in user_input:
                # Return a random response from the appropriate category
                return random.choice(response_templates[category])

    # Default response if no patterns match
    return "I'm still learning. Can you tell me more?"

def save_conversation():
    """Save the current conversation to a file."""
    # Create 'chats' directory if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists('chats'):
        os.makedirs('chats')

    # Generate a unique filename with timestamp
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    filename = f"chats/chat_with_{user_name}_{timestamp}.txt"

    try:
        with open(filename, "w") as f:
            # Write header information
            f.write(f"Conversation with {bot_name} and {user_name}\n")
            f.write(f"Date: {datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}\n\n")

            # Write each line of conversation
            for entry in conversation_history:
                f.write(f"{entry}\n")

        return filename
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error saving conversation: {str(e)}"

def load_conversation(filename):
    """Load a previous conversation from a file."""
    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            lines = f.readlines()

        print("\n----- Loaded Conversation -----")
        for line in lines:
            print(line.strip())
        print("-------------------------------\n")
        return True
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Sorry, I couldn't find the file '{filename}'.")
        # Show available files
        show_available_chats()
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
        return False

def show_available_chats():
    """Show a list of available saved conversations."""
    if not os.path.exists('chats'):
        print("No saved conversations found.")
        return

    chat_files = os.listdir('chats')
    if not chat_files:
        print("No saved conversations found.")
        return

    print("\nAvailable saved conversations:")
    for i, chat_file in enumerate(chat_files, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {chat_file}")
    print("\nTo load a conversation, type 'load' followed by the filename.")

# Main chat loop
bot_name = "PyBot"
print(f"Hello! I'm {bot_name}. Type 'bye' to exit.")
print("Special commands:")
print("- 'save': Save the current conversation")
print("- 'chats': Show available saved conversations")
print("- 'load <filename>': Load a conversation")

user_name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Nice to meet you, {user_name}!")

conversation_history = []

def save_to_history(speaker, text):
    """Save an utterance to conversation history."""
    conversation_history.append(f"{speaker}: {text}")

# Save initial greeting
save_to_history(bot_name, f"Nice to meet you, {user_name}!")

while True:
    user_input = input(f"{user_name}> ")
    save_to_history(user_name, user_input)

    # Check for special commands
    if user_input.lower() == "bye":
        response = f"Goodbye, {user_name}!"
        print(f"{bot_name}> {response}")
        save_to_history(bot_name, response)
        break
    elif user_input.lower() == "save":
        filename = save_conversation()
        print(f"{bot_name}> Conversation saved to {filename}")
        save_to_history(bot_name, f"Conversation saved to {filename}")
        continue
    elif user_input.lower() == "chats":
        show_available_chats()
        continue
    elif user_input.lower().startswith("load "):
        filename = user_input[5:].strip()
        load_conversation(filename)
        continue

    # Get and display response
    response = get_response(user_input)
    print(f"{bot_name}> {response}")
    save_to_history(bot_name, response)
```

With these enhancements, our chatbot can now:
1. Save conversations to text files with timestamps
2. Load and display previous conversations
3. List available saved conversation files
4. Organize saved chats in a dedicated directory

This makes the chatbot more useful, as you can review past interactions and continue conversations later.

**Challenges**:
- Add a feature to save conversations in JSON format
- Implement automatic periodic saving
- Create a settings file that remembers user preferences
- Add the ability to search through saved conversations for specific keywords
- Implement a feature to pick up a conversation where it left off

## Real-World File Applications

Files are fundamental to many programming tasks. Here are some common real-world applications:

1. **Configuration Files**: Store application settings in a format like JSON or INI.
   ```python
   import json

   # Load configuration
   with open('config.json', 'r') as f:
       config = json.load(f)

   # Use configuration
   theme = config['theme']
   ```

2. **Data Processing**: Read, process, and write large datasets.
   ```python
   # Process a CSV file line by line
   with open('large_data.csv', 'r') as input_file:
       with open('processed_data.csv', 'w') as output_file:
           for line in input_file:
               processed_line = process_line(line)  # Your processing function
               output_file.write(processed_line)
   ```

3. **Logging**: Keep track of program execution and errors.
   ```python
   def log_event(message):
       with open('app.log', 'a') as log_file:
           timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
           log_file.write(f"{timestamp} - {message}\n")
   ```

4. **User Data Storage**: Save user preferences, history, or created content.
   ```python
   def save_user_profile(username, profile_data):
       filename = f"users/{username}.json"
       os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(filename), exist_ok=True)
       with open(filename, 'w') as f:
           json.dump(profile_data, f)
   ```

5. **Caching**: Store results of expensive operations for future use.
   ```python
   import os
   import json

   def get_data(query, use_cache=True):
       cache_file = f"cache/{query.replace(' ', '_')}.json"

       # Check for cached result
       if use_cache and os.path.exists(cache_file):
           with open(cache_file, 'r') as f:
               return json.load(f)

       # Perform expensive operation
       result = expensive_operation(query)

       # Cache the result
       os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(cache_file), exist_ok=True)
       with open(cache_file, 'w') as f:
           json.dump(result, f)

       return result
   ```

These examples illustrate how file operations are essential for creating practical, real-world applications that persist data beyond a single program execution.
